Subject: [Btg-devel] Debian Package "btg-daemon" has missing dependency
	(libcurl-gnutls.so.4)
Message-ID: <200807182250.17244.stefan.bauer@cs.tu-chemnitz.de>

Hi,


the Debian Package btg-daemon-0.9.8 from your repository is missing a 
dependecy to libcurl3-gnutls-7.18.2-5, which provides the necessary object 
libcurl-gnutls.so.4.

Error message:
$>/etc/init.d/btg-daemon start  
Starting BTG ...
/usr/bin/btgdaemon: error while loading shared libraries: libcurl-gnutls.so.4: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Manually installing libcurl3-gnutls/testing solves the problem.


Regards,
Stefan

Subject: [Btg-devel] Debian Package "btg-ncli" has missing dependency
	(libtorrent-0.13.so)
Message-ID: <200807182357.48092.stefan.bauer@cs.tu-chemnitz.de>

Hi,


the Debian Package btg-ncli-0.9.8 from your repository is missing a 
dependency to libtorrent-rasterbar-0.13, which provides the necessary object 
libtorrent-0.13.so.

Error message:
$>btgncli 
btgncli: error while loading shared libraries: libtorrent-0.13.so: cannot open 
shared object file: No such file or directory

Manually installing libtorrent-rasterbar solves the problem.

Please note that this system only runs the client, so no btg-daemon is 
installed. The server running the daemon is a different machine in the 
network.


Regards,
Stefan

Hi, Michael,
Why our *cli is linked against libtorrent?
Have you fixed this already?

roma at firewall:~$ ldd `which btgncli` | grep torrent
        libtorrent-0.13.so => /usr/lib/libtorrent-0.13.so (0xb773f000)
roma at firewall:~$ btgncli -V
Parsing command line arguments failed: unknown option -V
