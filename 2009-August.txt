Subject: [Btg-devel] Fast resume data
Message-ID: <20090816235504.5630b1a8@netpc5.home.wojci.dk>

Roman,

To continue our conversation from IRC.

21:03 < wojci> roma_: I am looking at the issue with saving fast
resume. The only fix I see is moving the alert handling to its own
thread. 21:03 < wojci> roma_: And using a semaphore to decide when the
required alert has been generated.
21:04 < wojci> roma_: I began looking at this, since you have done
nothing to fix it.
#libtorrent 21:11 < roma_> wojci: but actually this is done already
21:12 < roma_> wojci: have you understood why resume data is rejected?
21:14 < roma_> wojci: current approach _should_work or we have to stop
the torrent before resume alert is received, which is
inefficient

I don't know why data is rejected - and I will not know, since the
alert about resume not being written is not received by the alert
handler in context_alert.cpp.

I want for a context to wait to the fast data to be saved - this does
not happen AFAIK.

So I think that when the daemon is being shut down (only when using
lt 0.14.x), it starts to write fast resume data, but does not wait for
the write to complete before removing the context. This is probably the
source of the problem that I experience -> missing fast resume data. It
probably works fine when fast resume data is written together with
saved sessions.

So, writing an additional alert handler is not a problem, right?
Just write some log message when this resume_data_rejected alert is
received.

That's right, is it necessary?

Well, resume data is saved regularly but asynchronously. When the daemon
exits,
there is resume data for downloading torrents but it's a bit stale (1
minute stale, actually).
According to LT code I dug, it should correctly handle such conditions
unless compact allocation mode (which we don't use).

I was not able to find any way of _not_ polling for alerts. Do you know a
way? In the current architecture, a thread polls alerts in each context
each 10 second or so.

I was thinking about adding a thread which only checks for alerts and
nothing else. But it would need to check for alerts for each session with
X contexts each. Maybe it does not matter, but I suspect that getting the
confirmation that you saved fast resume data could be delayed.

That could be enough to trigger a re-check of the torrent's data. I would
like to avoid that..

I thought that compact allocation mode was the default (in BTG), and you
could use full allocation if you wanted to.

No, I don't know either.
May be it's not bad to pass such information via alerts...

There are 3 allocation modes in 0.14.2:
full - all files are allocated at once and filled by 0-bytes
sparse - generic unix "sparse" files as we know them well
compact - some "tricky" mode when files are smaller than in full mode
but pieces are always travel inside that files, used for MacOS where
sparse mode is not supported AFAIK, see docs, it's hard to explain for
me :-/

So, I thought we use "sparse" mode, not "compact".
If we really use "compact" mode - the source of problem is obvious. In
this mode outdated resume data is rejected anyway.
But in sparse and full allocation modes outdated resume data works well.
Do you really need to support "compact" mode for your appletv or so?
May be "full allocation" will be suitable for you? since "compact" mode
is rather disk-io-voracious.

I meant sparse but wrote compact. :/

Never mind. I fixed this issue with saving fast resume data, it seems.
See bug #16157. 

Would you mind reviewing it?

This can be backported to 1.x, I guess. But it adds a thread and
requires some other changes as well. I am about to remove support for
lt < 0.14.x in trunk.

getpass() is being used in BTG. From the man page "This function is
obsolete.  Do not use it." We use it. :)

So my guess is that it returns NULL on your distro/OS, because someone
decided to remove the functionality. We will have to reimplement
stdIn::getPassword(..) so it works on all the supported operating systems.

What distro/OS are you using?

Do you mind adding a bug about it using our bug tracker?

You don't have your old config, do you?  That would make things easier.

It's been some time since I've used BTG, but it seems to me that you're
telling it to store session data in a directory that doesn't exist.
Double-check the path and permissions.

I haven't used BTG for some 6 months now, so I'm not really familiar

someone'll probably come along who could help better than I.

Try running (from bash):
btgdaemon -v -n

this will make the daemon not detach from your terminal and print
messages to stdout about what it is doing. An error message
will most likely be printed to stdout, when you attempt to create a
session.

Your log tells me that your password is incorrect. This is the only
reason for this message that I can see in the source.

Notice that you are using an untested version of BTG - I mean 2.x.
While trunk works for me, the RC1 was slightly fscked, as some
synchronization was not implemented.
