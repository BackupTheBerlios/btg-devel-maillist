Subject: [Btg-devel] BTG Installation under Ubuntu 8.04
Message-ID: <4814DF61.7000703@lewandowski.org.uk>

Hi,

I've used the information (once translated) at 
http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/BTG to install BTG on my new Ubuntu 8.04 
server and have hit a problem when trying to run btgpasswd

  btgpasswd --create -a -t "/mnt/sdb/torrents" -w "/mnt/sdb/work" -d 
"/mnt/sdb/finished" -s "/mnt/sdb/seeding" -p -u gavinlew

btgpasswd: error while loading shared libraries: libtorrent-0.13.so: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I have searched google and cannot find any references to this - no 
failures were reported when the package was being built and I cannot 
progress any further.

Any hints / tips would be welcome.

Kind Regards,

Gavin

You can try to use this repositories: http://btg.berlios.de/packages.html
At least, libtorrent-0.13 is here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/btg/debian/dists/other/stable/binary-i386

http://btg.berlios.de/faq.html#error-while-loading-shared-libraries

While the FAQ entry is very short, it means that you need to tell you
system where to find the libtorrent library. The man page mentioned should
give you a few clues.

Or you can use Roman's packages - using packages should take care of any
problems with finding libs at runtime.

Subject: [Btg-devel] 0.9.7 ebuild
Message-ID: <200804301137.30488.peter@peerweb.nl>

Hello BTG users and developers,

It seems btg in Gentoo portage is dependent on libtorrent 0.12. Since 0.13 is 
available with the unstable (~x86 ~amd64) keywords, perhaps an ebuild for 
0.9.7 ~amd64 could be merged into the official portage tree. As far as I 
could tell there are no new configuration options. By copying the 0.9.6 
ebuild and adjusting the download location I was able to emerge btg with 
rb_libtorrent 0.13 without problems.

Actually, there already is a thread about this on Gentoo's bugzilla : 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214491
It looks like there are some problems. I should test that next days.
