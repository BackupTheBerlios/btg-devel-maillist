<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for the quick answer!

&gt;<i> &gt; The first is about using Cyrus SASL (<A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/">http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to authenticate users.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cyrus SASL is specifically designed as a glue layer for adding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentication support to connection-based protocols. It supports a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of authentication methods. So IMHO it fits great between BTG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; daemon and clients and surely allows more flexibility than plain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passwd-like file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm going to use BTG in a multiuser network on a standalone server

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seamlessly. So this is my motivation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding SASL support sounds like a good idea.
</I>
Good!

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you want to see it in the main development branch?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would not mind including it, if you do the implementation. A few
</I>&gt;<i> points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Add a bug about this.
</I>&gt;<i> - Use SVN trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> - Make sure that the SASL lib used is detected by the configure
</I>&gt;<i> script.
</I>&gt;<i> - Send a patch that we can review.
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i> - Make sure that using SASL can be disabled at compile time, as with
</I>&gt;<i> most other features in BTG.
</I>&gt;<i> - A plain password file has to work as well, if you configure it at
</I>&gt;<i> compile time. For backwards compatibility. Making changes to the auth
</I>&gt;<i> interface used might be required.
</I>
I'd like to talk a bit more about it. The current password file handles
actually both authentication and authorization (and also the
directories). Only the users that are mentioned there are allowed to
create sessions. The current approach has a lot of problems IMO:
  * custom authentication scheme with custom passwords for users which
    makes it harder to administer
  * mixing both authentication and authorization is a problem because
    SASL can do advanced authentication but has no means for
    authorization i.e. allowing/restricting known users
  * also I think that directories should be per-session, not per-user
    but this is a bit off-topic

IMHO the current scheme should be deprecated as soon as SASL is
adopted. Just because it mixes everything in one place. Of course,
there could be work-arounds, like ignoring the password field in the
password file. But I think this will only distract users.

SASL has already good means for handling plain password files. I mean
the traditional passwd files :) It supports a lot of other sources of
information about passwords including PAM.

Instead of preserving the current password file it would be better to
split it into at least two files:
  * users/passwords for authentication
  * user restrictions + directories

If you don't want SASL as a dependency (on embedded systems likely)
than authentication can be handled by the system (/etc/passwd,
PAM, ...). So I really don't see any reason to keep the user/passwords
file.

SASL will allow even more advanced authentication if installed.

BTW, on user restrictions. I'd really like to introduce
per-group restrictions along with per-user which you have now. For
example:

allowed_users = joe, bob, ...
allowed_groups = btg, staff, ...

But this is not related to SASL. This is what I'd like to do after
adopting SASL. :) And per-session directories too maybe.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I'll try to implement it myself unless somebody is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not heard about anyone working on this. SASL support is not
</I>&gt;<i> something that I need myself, but I can help you if you have questions
</I>&gt;<i> about the parts of BTG that you need to modify.
</I>
I didn't look at the code yet so I don't have questions at the
moment. :)
But I will be happy to get any kind of information about the design of
the daemon, about where to look and how you expect me to do the
integration.
