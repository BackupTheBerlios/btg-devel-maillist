<PRE>Hi Michael,

Sorry, I was away for a couple of days...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to talk a bit more about it. The current password file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handles actually both authentication and authorization (and also the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directories). Only the users that are mentioned there are allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create sessions. The current approach has a lot of problems IMO:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * custom authentication scheme with custom passwords for users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which makes it harder to administer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * mixing both authentication and authorization is a problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because SASL can do advanced authentication but has no means for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     authorization i.e. allowing/restricting known users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * also I think that directories should be per-session, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per-user but this is a bit off-topic
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no real reason for why BTG uses a custom password file. If
</I>&gt;<i> you want to use a better approach, just remember that some people,
</I>&gt;<i> like me, us the daemon on a system with only one user, so using a more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated approach could be overkill to setup.
</I>
Sure, it would be an overkill for simple setups, I see.

&gt;<i> I don't know who a typical BTG user is. I suspect that most of the
</I>&gt;<i> users just use the daemon by themselves and maybe a couple of friends.
</I>
Well, BTG can reach other &quot;markets&quot; too. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO the current scheme should be deprecated as soon as SASL is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adopted. Just because it mixes everything in one place. Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there could be work-arounds, like ignoring the password field in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password file. But I think this will only distract users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SASL has already good means for handling plain password files. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean the traditional passwd files :) It supports a lot of other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sources of information about passwords including PAM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I sure hope that you understand the difference between a BTG user and
</I>&gt;<i> a system user. There is not a 1:1 mapping between them. Currently the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon runs as one system user and a BTG client can login using hash
</I>&gt;<i> of a password stored in the BTG passwd file, communicating with the
</I>&gt;<i> btg daemon. Files are written by the daemon as the user it runs as. It
</I>&gt;<i> does not matter which BTG user created the session that writes the
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have been planning to create a BTG 2.x branch for future
</I>&gt;<i> development. It would make sense to upgrade the auth system the way
</I>&gt;<i> you want it on this branch. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally just need it to be easy to use BTG on a system where I am
</I>&gt;<i> the only user on. You also mention embedded systems like routers and
</I>&gt;<i> NAS boxen. It should be possible to use some kind of simple auth for
</I>&gt;<i> these kind of systems.
</I>
Ok, I think the following scheme will address all issues:
 * the source of authentication information will be either plain
custom passwd file or PAM. Or other methods, like Kerberos. And this
can be configurable.
 * if btgdaemon is running as root and the users are authenticated as
real system users, than it sets uid/gid of all the user files it is
working on.
 * when a client connects to daemon, it asks about the daemon's
capabilities (this is requierd for SASL anyway). The &quot;simple&quot;
authentication mecthod will be there by default (unless disabled in
the daemon config). If SASL is compiled in, then it will add it's own
mechanisms. Then the client can choose.
 * the defaults in all config files will be matching the &quot;simple&quot; case

&gt;<i> So, if you can make sure that adding users works in a similar way as
</I>&gt;<i> with the current release (see btgpasswd), I would be happy.
</I>
This is great! Then I'll just change btgpasswd, keeping its user
interface untouched.

&gt;<i> &gt; Instead of preserving the current password file it would be better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to split it into at least two files:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * users/passwords for authentication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * user restrictions + directories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you don't want SASL as a dependency (on embedded systems likely)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than authentication can be handled by the system (/etc/passwd,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PAM, ...). So I really don't see any reason to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user/passwords file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See the comment I wrote about BTG vs. system users.
</I>
Thanks for the clarification!

&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't look at the code yet so I don't have questions at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moment. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I will be happy to get any kind of information about the design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the daemon, about where to look and how you expect me to do the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can start by looking at the doxygen comments (make doxygen, I
</I>&gt;<i> think, should create a number of html files). Components are separated
</I>&gt;<i> by namespaces. If you run the daemon with &quot;btgdaemon -v -n&quot;, it will
</I>&gt;<i> write helpful comments about the components/interfaces it is
</I>&gt;<i> initializing. You could start by looking at the interfaces first to
</I>&gt;<i> get an overview. Finally, you can ask for help on IRC (#libtorrent,
</I>&gt;<i> freenode).
</I>
Ok, thanks!
Is there any documentation on the client-server protocol? BTW, is it
XMLRPC-based for all transports? It seems to me (after looking at the
code) that &quot;xmlrpc/sxmlrpc&quot; transport is actually &quot;http/https&quot;
transport with XMLRPC-based protocol atop the transport layer.

I will have to add at least the &quot;capability&quot; request if not present.
