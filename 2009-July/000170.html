There is no real reason for why BTG uses a custom password file. If you
want to use a better approach, just remember that some people, like me,
us the daemon on a system with only one user, so using a more
complicated approach could be overkill to setup.

I don't know who a typical BTG user is. I suspect that most of the
users just use the daemon by themselves and maybe a couple of friends.

&gt;<i> IMHO the current scheme should be deprecated as soon as SASL is
</I>&gt;<i> adopted. Just because it mixes everything in one place. Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> there could be work-arounds, like ignoring the password field in the
</I>&gt;<i> password file. But I think this will only distract users.
</I>
&gt;<i> SASL has already good means for handling plain password files. I mean
</I>&gt;<i> the traditional passwd files :) It supports a lot of other sources of
</I>&gt;<i> information about passwords including PAM.
</I>
I sure hope that you understand the difference between a BTG user and
a system user. There is not a 1:1 mapping between them. Currently the
daemon runs as one system user and a BTG client can login using hash of
a password stored in the BTG passwd file, communicating with the btg
daemon. Files are written by the daemon as the user it runs as. It
does not matter which BTG user created the session that writes the
files.

We have been planning to create a BTG 2.x branch for future
development. It would make sense to upgrade the auth system the way you
want it on this branch. 

I personally just need it to be easy to use BTG on a system where I am
the only user on. You also mention embedded systems like routers and
NAS boxen. It should be possible to use some kind of simple auth for
these kind of systems.

So, if you can make sure that adding users works in a similar way as
with the current release (see btgpasswd), I would be happy.

&gt;<i> Instead of preserving the current password file it would be better to
</I>&gt;<i> split it into at least two files:
</I>&gt;<i>   * users/passwords for authentication
</I>&gt;<i>   * user restrictions + directories
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't want SASL as a dependency (on embedded systems likely)
</I>&gt;<i> than authentication can be handled by the system (/etc/passwd,
</I>&gt;<i> PAM, ...). So I really don't see any reason to keep the user/passwords
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>
See the comment I wrote about BTG vs. system users.

&gt;<i> I didn't look at the code yet so I don't have questions at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment. :)
</I>&gt;<i> But I will be happy to get any kind of information about the design of
</I>&gt;<i> the daemon, about where to look and how you expect me to do the
</I>&gt;<i> integration.
</I>
You can start by looking at the doxygen comments (make doxygen, I
think, should create a number of html files). Components are separated
by namespaces. If you run the daemon with &quot;btgdaemon -v -n&quot;, it will
write helpful comments about the components/interfaces it is
initializing. You could start by looking at the interfaces first to get
an overview. Finally, you can ask for help on IRC (#libtorrent,
freenode).
