Subject: [Btg-devel] Error when reseeding a torrent
Message-ID: <7a95af970805021723r43b771cag80cc107b5804d161@mail.gmail.com>

Just updated to the latest SVN and when I try to re-seed the wwwUI
freezez (kind of; every torrent disappears) and gives me this message:

Failed to list contexts: Failed to obtain file information

after a while, i figured when it's done hashing (?), it returns back to normal.

any clues what can be the problem?

I think that its a bug caused by the fix for #13460
(http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=13460&group_id
=3293).

I commited a fix (rev 327). Give it a try. 

There are some states, like when a torrent is hash checking, where
libtorrent will not give information about the contained files in the
torrent which is being hash checked to the daemon.

I could attempt to do something about some of the issues mentioned.

From the bug:

I have no idea what this is about, but if I knew, I would do something
about it. :)

This is not going to be used after lt 0.14 gets released. UPnP from
libtorrent is going to be used. Right now this is broken (in SVN) and
should not be used.

Debian, which I use for developing, has no plotmm package that I could
find. 

I could add detection to the configure script, I guess.

I did not have any problems with plotmm and gtkmm 2.4.

d) Comes bundled with xmlrpc-epi (http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/)
which in turns includes Yet Another Version Of Expat (tm) ;-)

I was not able to find a package for it in debian, but debian is
somewhat conservative. I guess that the configure script should try to
detect if xmlrpc is installed system-wide before using the one in
'external'.

Mounir/Peter, would you be so kind and add some BTG bugs? That is if you
want me to issues with Gentoo in BTG instead of maintaining patches in
Gentoo..

Roman,

What is your reason for using floats in contextUrlStatusResponseCommand?
Would you mind changing it so that integers are used instead?

I think that better to use floats.
the reasons:
1) curl gives us doubles
2) there isn't need in precision in minor numbers, but there is in
higher and exponent

why not float? it consumes just 4 bytes and able to describe >1M numbers
in that particular task

What about hw where you have to emulate floating point in software?

I just wanted you to think about a way of avoiding using floats, if
possible. If not, then leave it as it is.

I see your point, but libcurl itself uses doubles and we depend on it.
Generally we can disable all this part of functionality when building
for the embedded.

Btw, FP emulation code works only when there is an ALU operation to do.
On the daemon side there is only conversion from double to float,
which can be omitted by introducing t_double our type, which consumes
twice more memory.
If we use integer, there will be conversion from double to integer,
which a bit more complicated than between floats.

XML converts floats rather fast (just serializing it's internal
representation, I think,
since internal representation of float-like types is standardized by
IEEE and should be equal on all systems).

For as-needed, I have talk with Tiziano and he explained me that is a 
LDFLAG with wich you can't build btg.
I've submitted a  bug about this on btg bug tracker : 
https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=13738&group_id=3293 
with the patch proposed by Tiziano.

I will open new btg bugs about other problems when I will have the time for.

I see boost 1.35 is masked on Gentoo. Why using a masked version ? May 
be you try with boost-1.34.1-r2

Tried with 1.34-1-r2 before and got the same error but it worked fined with
the --with-boost-* options added. Had problem with that before but always
clueless on where to start looking.

Thanks anyways.

It works with all --with-boost-* options but why is it necessary now ?

Actually we're thinking how to solve it. It's temporarily problem.

For now the BOOST detection scripts expects BOOST_LDFLAGS environment
variable set,
and searches for the libraries there (e.g.
BOOST_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/boost-1.34.1/lib,
or BOOST_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib").
I think we can set this variable in configure itself, if it wasn't set
from the outside.

--with-boost-* configure params is just another way

Message-ID: <7a95af970805170538h5a3420f4kda37c38b88c39949@mail.gmail.com>

Been thinking of what the "last" button on the second row could be (after
'Session name', under 'Hide all details');

A session switch button/menu. Either a button that changes pages (like
rename and global limit does) and shows all session or a drop-down menu like
in the first page.

Would make having several sessions so much easier.

Well, just a thought.. What do you think?

Did you try "Detach session" ?
Seems it does exactly what you want.

Hum, well.. Yeah, actually, now that I think about it..

So what I want is probably the drop-down-menu in the first page on the
current-session-page without the attach-button (it attaches automatically
when selected in the menu). Because as it is now I feel that it is too many
steps in switching between sessions. Say you want to check your other
session then you have to do detach -> choose in menu -> attach -> *check* ->
detach -> choose again -> attach.

At least for me it makes me not using sessions when I actually like the
idea, keeping things separated: incoming, music, series, movies,
applications etc.. But as it is now I end up with only using one.

I'm not so good in explaining :/

Use only one session, at least a session per tracker,
because each session uses different TCP port and some trackers don't
understand
that client can connect from different ports simultaneously.
Also separate sessions consume much more resources (memory, threads)
then if you use only single session for everything.

Would you like to add this functionality to the wwwui or do you want us
to add it for you?

We accept patches. :)

No one besides jstrom is. And I am sure that jstrom is too busy to add
features to the www ui.

Please try and ask for help on IRC, if you need it.

Hi,
There's something wrong with autogen.sh. Why do aclocal and automake have the version number in their command name? It doesnt work, had to edit those parts out to make it work.

aclocal -I m4

automake --add-missing --copy --gnu

This worked. Running fedora here.

Subject: [Btg-devel] [PATCH] Don't require GTK 2.12 for btgui
Message-ID: <20080526185924.GA21330@ares.tgcnet>

Hello,

The use of BUTTONBOX_CENTER in urldialog.cpp raises the GTK requirement from
2.6 to 2.12. This is unnecessary IMHO since other dialogs are using
BUTTONBOX_END and the gui is otherwise working fine with GTK 2.6.

I propose the attached patch to allow btgui to continue to work with GTK
2.6. I tested it with trunk (r377) on CentOS 5 and it seems to be
working fine.

Which version of gtkmm are you using? 

Maybe I can try to build using the same version and see if I can
reproduce the problem..

Yes, sorry for not stating that. It was only later that i figured out
it had to do with gtkmm, hence i didnt do --enable-gui after which it
compiled successfully. Im using v 2.5.12, default package in fedora 9.
I suppose youre using svn.

Try using SVN and see if it works for you. I am waiting for another
developer to finish a task before I can do another RC release. But 0.9.7
is just fine.

You are using libtorrent 0.12. See if you still have this problem if you
upgrade to 0.13, which BTG 0.9.7 works with as well. If I remember
correctly, the CPU load issue was with libtorrent 0.12 only.

Thank you for the howto and testing. :)
