Hi,

I have no idea if this is the proper place to ask, but I will give it a  
shot anyway.

I changed my home server from Gentoo Linux to FreeBSD 7. No specific  
reason other than my curiosity. Anyway, all is working fine so far, except  
for BTG which is completely crashing the system after adding a torrent  
(using www ui). 0.9.9-RC1 crashes the system immediately after uploading a  
torrent. When turning on the server's screen, I see nothing but characters  
flashing over the screen really quick. I also just tried 0.9.8, which  
started to download, but ended up freezing the server within the minute  
(can still ping the server, but can't do anything else on it).

I installed all packages using pkg_add and compiled BTG myself. I did  
notice the FreeBSD notes in the current HOWTO, but could not put them to  
use. I got some error about not being able to use -ltorrent-rasterbar. I  
have no further info at this time, since I still have to reboot the  
crashed server from my 0.9.8 attempt.

I hope this is some mistake on my side and anyone can tell me what I am  
doing wrong, since there is no better torrent daemon for linux/unix  
available than BTG, in my opinion.

Regards,
Jurriaan Nijkamp

Are they from the BTG daemon process which logs to stdout?

An user space application is not supposed to be able to crash your whole
server. A faulty driver could lead to the described behaviour.

Can you simulate IO load in any other way to make sure that its not the
fault of BTG/webserver?

I am currently not aware of any issues with BTG on FreeBSD. What you tell
me is not enough to identify any problem with your BTG installation.

Hello again,

I'm giving the installation another shot and this time I am adding the  
FreeBSD specific configuration flags which were mentioned in the HOWTO  
(current) on the website. The configure step gives me an error, though. I  
am applying them to 0.9.8 at this moment, but 0.9.9-RC1 gave me the same  
error.

Short version -- configure: error: Unable to link with required libraries.

I have uploaded my config.log to http://jurrie.net/misc/config.log.bz2  
hoping you are willing to check it out and see if you can find what's  
wrong. Though I have some experience compiling, I'm not adept enough to  
figure out these kinds of errors.

The BSD installation is very fresh (new install this morning) and I only  
added some neccesary packages required for BTG. I added all of them using  
pkg_add, not by compiling them from ports.

Noteable:
- rblibtorrent 0.13
- boost 1.34.1
- gnutls 2.4.1_1
- autotools 20080819
- curl 7.18.0

FreeBSD 7.0-p5, amd64

I ran autogen.sh and am configuring like this:

./configure --enable-www --enable-cli --enable-url  
LIBTORRENT_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltorrent-rasterbar"  
LIBTORRENT_CFLAGS="-DTORRENT_USE_OPENSSL -D_THREAD_SAFE -pthread  
-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/libtorrent" LIBS="-lpthread"

(the quotes were needed or configure wouldn't accept it)

If you need any other information from me, I'd be happy to oblige.
Thank you very much in advance.

Regards,
Jurriaan Nijkamp

I hate replying to myself, but I guess this time it's a good thing.

It was a wild guess of mine, but I made a minor change to the configure  
line. I replaced

LIBTORRENT_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltorrent-rasterbar"

with

LIBTORRENT_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltorrent"

and the configure stage completed. Afterwards a make install completed the  
job.

This time around I used apache 2.0 (2.2 previously) since it did not  
require loading the kernel module accf_http. I don't have any proof, but  
my previous freezes may have had something to do with that module. Pure  
speculation though.

Anway, I launched my btgdaemon a few minutes ago and it is happily  
downloading a torrent at a nice speed, whereas previously the server just  
froze after a few seconds.

This case is closed now. I hope it will be of use to anyone out there ;-)
