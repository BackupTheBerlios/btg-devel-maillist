Message-ID: <4C0A3174.20009@email.it>

Hello!
Thanks for you help! ;-)
i was able to build btg 2 rc3 on fedora 12


Thank you  very much for btg! is fantastic.. :) :-*
I want to post a problem, i don't know if it is a bug.
from my windows computer i connect to my linux server and if i use 
firefox is not able to login at 192.168.1.101/btg
i put the login and password and then press login button and the page 
doesn't change if i use internet explore i can access

P.S. In firefox I did a click on the language flag and then again on the 
english flag, and now i'm able to login with firefox.

INCREDIBLE!!!!
