Hi,

I own a Buffalo Linkstation with an ARM-processor. I installed Debian on it
and want to have BTG running there :)

Since the ARM-processor doesn't have that much CPU-power, I'm trying to
cross-compile BTG on an AMD64.

./autogen.sh worked.

Now I'm trying
./configure --host=arm-linux-gnu

It works fine, until it comes to BOOST:

--cut--
checking BOOST includes in /usr/include... found
configure: Using BOOST_CPPFLAGS = -I/usr/include
checking whether the Boost::System library is available... no
configure: unable to find Boost.System library, this is not required unless
boost 1.3.5 or better is used.
checking whether the Boost::IOStreams library is available... no
configure: error: unable to find Boost.IOStreams library, currently this is
required.
--end--

I wonder, why I need an ARM-Boost.IOStreams library on my AMD64, if I want
to run it on ARM. :)
Or did I get something wrong?

Does anyone know how to cross-compile for ARM?

I would directly install the .deb-packages, but
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/btg/debian/dists/main/
only offers i386 packages.

Thank you in advance!

Hi,

I have a Buffalo Linkstation Live with an ARM processor and I am currently 
running BTG (daemon only + web UI).
I have installed Debian on the LS, and upgraded it to the "testing" branch.
I used libtorrent and libboost packages provided by standard apt repositories.
Then I was able to _natively_ compile BTG on the LS; I compiled just 
btgdaemon, btgcli and the web UI using the following options:

./configure --enable-btg-config --disable-gui --disable-viewer --enable-cli --
enable-www --disable-upnp --enable-session-saving --enable-event-callback --
enable-url

It took 4-5 hours. (BTG 0.9.9rc1)

Unfortunately I was not able to get cross-compilation up and running.

Hope it helps.

V.

You should look in config.log at why the test fails.

Take a look at the makefiles used to cross compile for openwrt - this is
mentioned in the howto. I think that when you cross compile, you need to
cross compile all the dependencies _first_ and then tell the configure
scripts where to find the headers/libs.

> Does anyone know how to cross-compile for ARM?

I think that cross compiling for ARM is more of less identical to cross
compiling for the ARCH i have been using with openwrt. In the sense that
you need to build a cross compiler (or use one provided by the distro),
the libs used then boost, libtorrent, btg dependencies and then btg.

Maybe you could tell us more about what you are doing. Where did you
install boost to?

You should not even consider building _on_ your device. Its not worth
waiting a couple of hours for what usually takes 10 minutes or so.

Have you looked at for example http://www.scratchbox.org?

Look at the makefiles for openwrt that I provide. They should give you
some clues about what to do and in what sequence.

Start by making sure that you can build the boost libs required by
libtorrent using bjam (if I remember correctly).

I would like you to try to install the xml-rpc from the Gentoo system
and try using it instead of the one you are using now (internal vs.
system wise). I remember that gentoo had patches for xmlrpc, of which I
merged some of. Maybe it could fix your issues. Do you have a 32 bit
system you could try to run the web server used by the wwwui? Just to
see if this is the issue..

The xml-rpc implementation used by PHP is something the developer who
implemented the wwwui integrated - it could possibly have some errors
in it.

I have some problems with using the xmlrpc library from Gentoo with btg.

BTG refuses to recognize it.

I tracked it down to the error that the btg configure expects a
XMLRPC_REQUEST macro which is not present.

Gentoo uses the xmlrpc library from  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/.

Is that the same library btg expects (are there more xmlrpc libraries
flooting around the net)?

regards,
Fitzgerald.

Before I switched my server to BSD it used to run Gentoo amd64. I have
used BTG 0.9.6 - 0.9.8 on it and used xmlrpc-c from portage.

I used an ebuild from this bug thread:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231105

It pulled in packages from the sunrise repository, xmlrpc-c included, I
think. Perhaps that thread is your answer.

Good luck,

Everybody thanks for the tips/help/suggestions.

Unfortunately I still haven't btg working.

I have tried Transmission and this works out-of-the-box.

For me this is a better alternative, at least at this moment.

regards,
Fitzgerald.

Are all the required files/directories present where the daemon can find
them?

Is your configuration working on pc?

Is it possible to use a debugger and find out what caused the segfault? On
most (I think) archs you can use a GDB remote part and run the debugger
itself on your PC. I think that you need more information, that is all.

Thanks, I've solved this problem using gdb (had to run with
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib as some cross-compiled libs differ from native
ones) and btgdaemon starts successfully.
Unfortunately, I'm unable to authorize using accounts created with
btgpasswd: btgncli first requests Username, then Password but doesn't start
the ncurses interface (the only message I get is "(clientdynconfig.cpp:64)
Can't find file /root/.btg/client.dynconfig").
Any suggestions?
Thank you,
Alex

Any logs from the daemon I can look at? Like the ones produced by
"btgdaemon -v -D -n".

Hello folks,

firstly, an happy new year to all of you guys in the time you will get

I'm currently having problem to get btgdaemon working properly.
Once launched, through the web interface after logged in, all my

continue) from any tracker i can test.
Seeder and leecher status are fine.

btgdaemon is not enough verbose to tell me what is going on.

Are your torrents in fact started? If libtorrent cannot write to the
files in your work directory, it will throw an exception, caught and
logged by BTG. This will stop the torrents.

Did you remember to configure "torrent-ip" and "torrent-range" in
your .btg/daemon.ini?

> btgdaemon is not enough verbose to tell me what is going on.

The application will not tell you if you use incorrect daemon.ini
entries, like "torrent-ip".

There is a debug option, which can be enabled at compile
time and using the "-D" argument to the daemon. You could also use
wireshark to log the BT protocol and see if you can figure out what is
going on.

Some update.

I do get some other feedback from btgncli: a couple minutes after entering
password i get

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(statemachine.cpp:713) Dying: attempt to change to an illegal state.
From=SM_ERROR, to=SM_ERROR.
0: create new session.
Enter a number:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entering '0' gives me "Error: Unable to create new session."

Entiring any other number just gets me promped to enter a number again.
