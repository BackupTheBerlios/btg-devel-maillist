Subject: [Btg-devel] Gentoo ebuild for btg-0.9.0
Message-ID: <45FD3054.4090005@gmail.com>

Hello,

I've wrote a Gentoo ebuild for btg-0.9.0. Actually, it is based on the 
actual ebuild (from tarball) but improved. Indeed the ebuild had some 
various mistakes.
You can found the bug report on Gentoo Bugzilla here : 
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170925
The ebuild is also on an overlay, Gentoo Sunrise 
(www.gentoo-sunrise.org) and the file can be found here : 
http://gentoo-sunrise.org/svn/sunrise/net-p2p/btg/btg-0.9.0.ebuild

In addition, rb_libtorrent ebuild is now useless because it is in 
portage, named rblibtorrent.
